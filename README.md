# mac-setup
This is a WIP and I don't know when I done :D 

This is a repository for my macOS setup. It fits to my requierments and can be a helpful guideline for you, too. If something doesn't fit to your setup feel free to make adujustments or if you find a more general solution, you are also invited to make a pull request.

## Objectives
I want to achieve a automatic way to install the applications I need for my environment. This will be extendable by adding the name of the application in a configuration file. 

This will be less error-prone and accelerate the initial setup to start with your machine the things you want to achieve.
